Therefore a high percentage reduction is applied to each application for annual allocation of non-traditional operators.  Taking these elements into consideration the maximum percentage of 125  should be decreased.  The decrease takes into account the different percentage reductions in Quotas A and B and Quota C and also future developments of the annual allocation to non-traditional operators.  4 Regulation EC No 8962001 should be amended accordingly.  5 The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1.

Whereas the Council's objective in establishing the quotas was to strike a balance between an appropriate level of protection for the Community industries concerned and maintenance of an acceptable level of trade with China taking into account the various interest in play.  Whereas analysis of the main economic indicators in particular the volume and market share of Chinese imports leads to the conclusion that the quota on toys falling within HSCN codes 9503 41 9503 49 and 9503 90 should be abolished and that such abolition would be neither inconsistent with the above objective nor liable to disrupt the Community market.  Whereas in the light of the experience acquired in implementing the quotas the situation of the Community producers concerned indicates that a 5  upward adjustment of the quotas would be appropriate and would be neither inconsistent with the above objective nor liable to disrupt the Community market.  whereas however in the case of footwear the particularly sensitive nature of the industry indicates that for the time being no increase is appropriate.  Whereas the products in respect of which the quota is abolished by this Regulation should however be subject to prior Community surveillance in order to ensure adequate monitoring of the volume and prices of the imports of the products concerned.  Whereas the quantitative quotas and the surveillance measures introduced pursuant to Regulation EC No 51994 should therefore be amended HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1.

Application of the reference to paragraph 3 would mean in effect that the quantities transferred would be assigned to the producers in proportion to the average quantities delivered by them in the three years preceding the year of the most recent harvest without taking account of the acquired right of the producer applying for the transfer.  3 The measure in question should apply from the 1999 harvest HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1.

During this meeting scientific evidence was presented that the complement fixation test currently described in Annex D to Directive 90426EEC has serious limitations in particular because it is only suitable for detecting antibodies after a recent infection or vaccination.  Furthermore the test is in practice replaced by modern ELISA tests in almost all laboratories in the Community and also in major exporting countries.  3 The internationally accepted laboratory tests for the detection of antibodies against the African horse sickness virus are described in the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines3 of the Office International des Epizooties OIE.  however the current edition mentions only one of the ELISA tests available.  4 Therefore it appears appropriate to modify Annex D to Directive 90426EEC so as to take into account technical developments and internationally approved standards.  5 The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION Article 1.

Article 2 of that Regulation lays down the conditions under which rice may be accepted for intervention and Article 3 lays down the criteria for applying price increases and reductions in particular as regards the yield after processing.  2 Experience in recent marketing years has shown that yields after processing of rice offered for intervention are generally above the basic yields listed in Part B of Annex II to Regulation EC No 70898.  3 In order to strengthen the role of intervention as a safety net and to encourage the production of high-quality rice the intervention criteria should be tightened up.  4 Adjustment of the yields after processing listed in Part B of Annex II to Regulation EC No 70898 together with a reduction in the current price increases and a reduction in the tolerances for divergence from the basic yield would appear to be the most effective ways of promoting the production of high-quality rice and at the same time ensuring the high quality of rice stored by the intervention agencies.  5 The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1.
